The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 23rd, Monday, 2020]. ||  
The round 3 started on April 6th, Monday, 2020. and Finished on April 8th, Wednesday, 2020.

## Log

### R2D1
Started a binary tree, my plan is for it to have functions as: add an element, show all the elements in preorder, show all elements in "inorder" and delete all the elements.
So far I have created the add fuction, but still need to work in the visualization functions to make sure it all works!

### R2D2
Completed the visualization functions, and everything is going perfect for the first four functions! 

### R2D3
Completed the delete function and it all works as it should! (I'm probably going to make comments on the code)
