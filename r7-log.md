## Log

### R6D1
Made another practice with MySQL, using more functions this time, on the first day I only created the Database


### R6D2
Started using the functions, my favorite one this time was the "START TRANSACTION; [...] COMMIT;", I also used the "CREATE VIEW" and worked some filters from the new view
