The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 23rd, Monday, 2020]. ||  
The round 3 started on May 13, Monday, 2020. and Finished on May 15, Wednesday, 2020.

## Log
Continued with my binary tree, I was only missing the Search and Delete functiosn, so I focused on that...

### R6D1
On the first day I focused on the search function, created one that used a while cicle to get to the correct element 


### R6D2
Found some videos about the delete function, and adapted the idea of the vloger to my code, end up changing the search functio to a recursive one, this way I can use it for the delete function 

### R6D3
Completed the delete function, I also had to add 2 functions to make the whole delete function works... 
I still have a problem with the elimination when the node of the tree only haves a right son (will work on this later this month, since I have a lot to do now)
