## Log

### R1D1
Started a Stack with 4 functions, such as: add an element, show all the elements in the stack from the last on to the fist one, show an specific element (search), delete an element and empty the full stack.
there are some details I still need to work on.

### R2D2
Completed the stack, fixed the details I had on the first try, also got some help with the search function; and now it completely works!
