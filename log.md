# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've achive most of the funtions of the queue, so, it's almost done I just need to make some adjustments.

**Thoughts** 
As I'm not good at proggraming, it was a big achivement for myself to make an almost funtional queue all by myself! 
Big mood: I'm exited.

**Thoughts** 
As I'm not good at proggraming, it was a big achivement for myself to make an funtional queue all by myself! 
Big mood: I'm more than exited.
