# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've achive most of the funtions of the queue, so, it's almost done I just need to make some adjustments.

**Thoughts** 
As I'm not good at proggraming, it was a big achivement for myself to make an almost funtional queue all by myself! 
Big mood: I'm exited.

### Day 3: March 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've stared a new proyect, a Stack in C lenguage!
I've made most of the code, i'm just missing details on the search function (not big deal, i hope)

**Thoughts** 
I feel like i'm improving in my proggraming skill, and I'm really happy about it!
Big mood: I capable!
